Create EXACTLY ONE PNG sprite sheet image.

CANVAS SIZE (ABSOLUTE, MUST MATCH EXACTLY):
- The final PNG must be exactly 1144×864 pixels.
- Do NOT add any extra padding, border, frame, shadow, or whitespace outside this canvas.
- Do NOT crop smaller than this size. Do NOT export larger than this size.

INVISIBLE GRID LAYOUT (DO NOT DRAW THE GRID):
- Grid is 4 columns × 3 rows.
- Each tile is exactly 256×256px.
- Horizontal gutter between tiles is exactly 24px, pure #FFFFFF.
- Vertical gutter between tiles is exactly 24px, pure #FFFFFF.
- Outer margin around the entire grid is exactly 24px on all 4 sides, pure #FFFFFF.
- Background everywhere (including gutters and margins) is flat pure white #FFFFFF.
- IMPORTANT: The grid is only for placement; do NOT draw borders, lines, boxes, frames, or separators.

EXTREME SPACING REQUIREMENT (THIS IS CRITICAL — DO NOT VIOLATE):
- The gutters (24px) MUST remain completely empty white space (#FFFFFF).
- NOTHING from a subject may enter the gutters: no outline, no shading, no anti-aliasing, no whiskers, no tails, no “soft edges”.
- Inside EACH tile there must be a DOUBLE SAFETY ZONE:
  1) SAFE PAD: Keep at least 56px of pure white padding INSIDE the tile on all 4 sides.
  2) GUTTER GUARD: Additionally keep a further 12px “no-ink” band INSIDE the tile edges.
- This means the entire subject must fit inside a centered 120×120px content box (47% of the tile).
- If uncertain, make subjects smaller. Whitespace is REQUIRED for correct slicing.

VERY IMPORTANT ANTI-OVERLAP RULE:
- The subject silhouette must not touch or approach the tile edge.
- Target subject size is only 55% of tile width/height (NOT 85%).
- Prefer smaller + well-centered over bigger.

GRID-LINE PREVENTION (READ CAREFULLY):
- Do NOT draw ANY grid lines, even faint.
- Do NOT draw a table, separators, dividers, guides, frames, borders, crop marks, bleed marks.
- Do NOT outline tiles.
- Do NOT add shading/noise in gutters or margins; they must be perfectly flat #FFFFFF.

FORBIDDEN (DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OF THESE):
- No table/grid lines, no tile borders, no separators, no outlines, no strokes in gutters/margins
- No outer border/frame around the whole sheet
- No gradients or shadows in gutters/margins (must be perfectly flat #FFFFFF)
- No text, no numbers, no labels, no watermark, no logo

ART STYLE (adult comic-based, keep as-is):
- modern editorial comic illustration for adults (NOT childish, NOT kawaii)
- clean inked linework: thin-to-medium uniform outlines on the subject only
- subtle cel shading (2–3 tone blocks), minimal gradients
- muted, mature palette; avoid neon / toy-like colors
- consistent lighting direction (top-left), subtle
- no shadows below or around the subject

TRANSPARENCY-SAFE RULES:
- absolutely NO drop shadow below or around the subject
- NO ground shadow, NO contact shadow, NO ambient shadow
- NO glow, NO halo, NO vignette
- background is pure white #FFFFFF
- do NOT use pure white (#FFFFFF) inside the subject (use lightly tinted highlights instead)

COMPOSITION (strict, for EVERY tile):
- One main subject per tile.
- Subject must be centered horizontally AND vertically.
- Subject scale must be consistent across tiles.
- Subject MUST stay entirely inside the centered 120×120px content box.
- The tile edges must remain pure white with no marks, no outline, no shading.
- Keep silhouettes compact; avoid thin protrusions that might approach edges.

BATCH LABEL (for humans only, not drawn): batch

TILES (exact order, left-to-right then top-to-bottom):
01. China (中国)
02. USA (美国)
03. Germany (德国)
04. Japan (日本)
05. Asia (亚洲)
06. Europe (欧洲)
07. Africa (非洲)
08. America (美洲)
09. continent (州)
10. Zurich (苏黎世)
11. Basel (巴塞尔)
