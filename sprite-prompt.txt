Create EXACTLY ONE PNG sprite sheet image.

CANVAS SIZE (ABSOLUTE, MUST MATCH EXACTLY):
- The final PNG must be exactly 1424×1144 pixels.
- Do NOT add any extra padding, border, frame, shadow, or whitespace outside this canvas.
- Do NOT crop smaller than this size. Do NOT export larger than this size.

INVISIBLE GRID LAYOUT (DO NOT DRAW THE GRID):
- Grid is 5 columns × 4 rows.
- Each tile is exactly 256×256px.
- Horizontal gutter between tiles is exactly 24px, pure #FFFFFF.
- Vertical gutter between tiles is exactly 24px, pure #FFFFFF.
- Outer margin around the entire grid is exactly 24px on all 4 sides, pure #FFFFFF.
- Background everywhere (including gutters and margins) is flat pure white #FFFFFF.
- IMPORTANT: The grid is only for placement; do NOT draw borders, lines, boxes, frames, or separators.

FORBIDDEN (DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OF THESE):
- No table/grid lines, no tile borders, no separators, no outlines, no strokes
- No outer border/frame around the whole sheet
- No gradients or shadows in gutters/margins (must be perfectly flat #FFFFFF)
- No text, no numbers, no labels, no watermark, no logo

ART STYLE (lock this style for all future sheets):
- clean minimal digital illustration, friendly, modern
- soft shading, simple shapes, slightly rounded forms
- consistent lighting from top-left
- consistent palette across the whole sheet
- subtle shadow ONLY under the subject (inside the tile), never in gutters/margins

COMPOSITION (strict, for EVERY tile):
- One main subject per tile.
- Subject must be centered horizontally AND vertically.
- Subject scale must be consistent across tiles.
- Subject should fill about 85% of tile height and about 85% of tile width.
- Keep at least 24px empty white padding inside each tile (nothing touches edges).
- Use consistent portrait framing for people: head + shoulders, same baseline and head position.
- If you add small icons (e.g., a heart), they must remain near the subject and inside the centered composition area (not near tile edges).

BATCH LABEL (for humans only, not drawn): people_family

01. person (人)
02. Chinese person (中国人)
03. father (爸爸)
04. mother (妈妈)
05. grandfather (祖父)
