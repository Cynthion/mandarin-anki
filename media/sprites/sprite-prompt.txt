Create EXACTLY ONE PNG sprite sheet image.

CANVAS SIZE (ABSOLUTE, MUST MATCH EXACTLY):
- The final PNG must be exactly 1704×1424 pixels.
- Do NOT add any extra padding, border, frame, shadow, or whitespace outside this canvas.
- Do NOT crop smaller than this size. Do NOT export larger than this size.

RENDERING OVERRIDES (CRITICAL):
- flat editorial illustration, printed-poster look
- paint-edge silhouettes ONLY (edges defined by color changes, not lines)
- absolutely no icon strokes, no sticker outlines, no contour strokes
- avoid dark edge rims; do NOT trace silhouettes
- no depth cues of any kind
- lighting is studio-flat and diffuse, evenly lit
- subject appears printed on white paper, not floating in space

INVISIBLE GRID LAYOUT (DO NOT DRAW THE GRID):
- Grid is 6 columns × 5 rows.
- Each tile is exactly 256×256px.
- Horizontal gutter between tiles is exactly 24px, pure #FFFFFF.
- Vertical gutter between tiles is exactly 24px, pure #FFFFFF.
- Outer margin around the entire grid is exactly 24px on all 4 sides, pure #FFFFFF.
- Background everywhere (including gutters and margins) is flat pure white #FFFFFF.
- IMPORTANT: The grid is only for placement; do NOT draw borders, lines, boxes, frames, or separators.

EXTREME SPACING REQUIREMENT (THIS IS CRITICAL — DO NOT VIOLATE):
- The gutters (24px) MUST remain completely empty white space (#FFFFFF).
- NOTHING from a subject may enter the gutters: no outline, no shading, no anti-aliasing, no whiskers, no tails, no “soft edges”.
- Inside EACH tile there must be a DOUBLE SAFETY ZONE:
  1) SAFE PAD: Keep at least 56px of pure white padding INSIDE the tile on all 4 sides.
  2) GUTTER GUARD: Additionally keep a further 12px “no-ink” band INSIDE the tile edges.
- This means the entire subject must fit inside a centered 120×120px content box (47% of the tile).
- If uncertain, make subjects smaller. Whitespace is REQUIRED for correct slicing.

VERY IMPORTANT ANTI-OVERLAP RULE:
- The subject silhouette must not touch or approach the tile edge.
- Target subject size is only 55% of tile width/height (NOT 85%).
- Prefer smaller + well-centered over bigger.

GRID-LINE PREVENTION (READ CAREFULLY):
- Do NOT draw ANY grid lines, even faint.
- Do NOT draw a table, separators, dividers, guides, frames, borders, crop marks, bleed marks.
- Do NOT outline tiles.
- Do NOT add shading/noise in gutters or margins; they must be perfectly flat #FFFFFF.
- treat the entire canvas as a single white poster
- tiles are implied only by spacing; do not visually reinforce them
- do not add any element to improve readability against white

FORBIDDEN (DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OF THESE):
- No table/grid lines, no tile borders, no separators, no outlines, no strokes in gutters/margins
- No outer border/frame around the whole sheet
- No gradients or shadows in gutters/margins (must be perfectly flat #FFFFFF)
- No text, no numbers, no labels, no watermark, no logo

ART STYLE (modern stylized anime / neo-ukiyo-e / cinematic pop illustration):
- modern stylized digital illustration with anime-inspired character design (NOT chibi, NOT kawaii)
- clean, confident linework with slightly bold outer contours and finer interior lines (subject only)
- smooth painterly shading with subtle cel-shading structure (2–4 tone blocks), minimal gradients
- high-contrast, poster-like finish; polished “key art” look (not sketchy)
- bold saturated but harmonized palette (reds/teals/golds/creams/blacks), avoid muddy colors
- elegant facial features, expressive eyes, fashion-forward styling
- optional decorative motif feel (neo-ukiyo-e / traditional patterns / pop graphic shapes) but keep backgrounds pure white
- consistent lighting direction (top-left), subtle highlights; NO cast shadows
- editorial print illustration (magazine / packaging art), not UI iconography
- no sticker, emoji, app icon, or game HUD styling
- color-block shading preferred over line-based definition

TRANSPARENCY-SAFE RULES (STRICT INTERPRETATION):
- ZERO grounding cues: no contact shadow, no cast shadow, no ambient shadow
- ZERO edge enhancement: no outline, no stroke, no rim light
- ZERO separation tricks: no halo, no glow, no vignette
- background is uniform flat #FFFFFF
- subject edges must end cleanly with color, not darkness
- highlights must be lightly tinted (cream, pale yellow), never pure white

COMPOSITION (strict, for EVERY tile):
- One main subject per tile.
- Subject must be centered horizontally AND vertically.
- Subject scale must be consistent across tiles.
- Subject MUST stay entirely inside the centered 120×120px content box.
- The tile edges must remain pure white with no marks, no outline, no shading.
- Keep silhouettes compact; avoid thin protrusions that might approach edges.
- silhouettes must remain compact and rounded
- avoid thin protrusions, spikes, drips, splashes, steam wisps, foam spray


BATCH LABEL (for humans only, not drawn): batch
