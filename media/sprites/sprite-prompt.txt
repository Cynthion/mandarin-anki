Create EXACTLY ONE PNG sprite sheet image.

CANVAS SIZE (ABSOLUTE, MUST MATCH EXACTLY):
- The final PNG must be exactly 1704×1424 pixels.
- Do NOT add any extra padding, border, frame, shadow, or whitespace outside this canvas.
- Do NOT crop smaller than this size. Do NOT export larger than this size.

INVISIBLE GRID LAYOUT (DO NOT DRAW THE GRID):
- Grid is 6 columns × 5 rows.
- Each tile is exactly 256×256px.
- Horizontal gutter between tiles is exactly 24px, pure #FFFFFF.
- Vertical gutter between tiles is exactly 24px, pure #FFFFFF.
- Outer margin around the entire grid is exactly 24px on all 4 sides, pure #FFFFFF.
- Background everywhere (including gutters and margins) is flat pure white #FFFFFF.
- IMPORTANT: The grid is only for placement; do NOT draw borders, lines, boxes, frames, or separators.

EXTREME SPACING REQUIREMENT (THIS IS CRITICAL — DO NOT VIOLATE):
- The gutters (24px) MUST remain completely empty white space (#FFFFFF).
- NOTHING from a subject may enter the gutters: no outline, no shading, no anti-aliasing, no whiskers, no tails, no “soft edges”.
- Inside EACH tile there must be a DOUBLE SAFETY ZONE:
  1) SAFE PAD: Keep at least 56px of pure white padding INSIDE the tile on all 4 sides.
  2) GUTTER GUARD: Additionally keep a further 12px “no-ink” band INSIDE the tile edges.
- This means the entire subject must fit inside a centered 120×120px content box (47% of the tile).
- If uncertain, make subjects smaller. Whitespace is REQUIRED for correct slicing.

VERY IMPORTANT ANTI-OVERLAP RULE:
- The subject silhouette must not touch or approach the tile edge.
- Target subject size is only 55% of tile width/height (NOT 85%).
- Prefer smaller + well-centered over bigger.

GRID-LINE PREVENTION (READ CAREFULLY):
- Do NOT draw ANY grid lines, even faint.
- Do NOT draw a table, separators, dividers, guides, frames, borders, crop marks, bleed marks.
- Do NOT outline tiles.
- Do NOT add shading/noise in gutters or margins; they must be perfectly flat #FFFFFF.

FORBIDDEN (DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OF THESE):
- No table/grid lines, no tile borders, no separators, no outlines, no strokes in gutters/margins
- No outer border/frame around the whole sheet
- No gradients or shadows in gutters/margins (must be perfectly flat #FFFFFF)
- No text, no numbers, no labels, no watermark, no logo

ART STYLE (adult comic-based, keep as-is):
- modern editorial comic illustration for adults (NOT childish, NOT kawaii)
- clean inked linework: thin-to-medium uniform outlines on the subject only
- subtle cel shading (2–3 tone blocks), minimal gradients
- muted, mature palette; avoid neon / toy-like colors
- consistent lighting direction (top-left), subtle
- no shadows below or around the subject

TRANSPARENCY-SAFE RULES:
- absolutely NO drop shadow below or around the subject
- NO ground shadow, NO contact shadow, NO ambient shadow
- NO glow, NO halo, NO vignette
- background is pure white #FFFFFF
- do NOT use pure white (#FFFFFF) inside the subject (use lightly tinted highlights instead)

COMPOSITION (strict, for EVERY tile):
- One main subject per tile.
- Subject must be centered horizontally AND vertically.
- Subject scale must be consistent across tiles.
- Subject MUST stay entirely inside the centered 120×120px content box.
- The tile edges must remain pure white with no marks, no outline, no shading.
- Keep silhouettes compact; avoid thin protrusions that might approach edges.

BATCH LABEL (for humans only, not drawn): batch
