Create EXACTLY ONE PNG sprite sheet image.

CANVAS SIZE (ABSOLUTE, MUST MATCH EXACTLY):
- The final PNG must be exactly 1424×1144 pixels.
- Do NOT add any extra padding, border, frame, shadow, or whitespace outside this canvas.
- Do NOT crop smaller than this size. Do NOT export larger than this size.

RENDERING OVERRIDES (CRITICAL):
- shadow-free sprites on pure white paper background
- use bold black ink linework (comic/pop linework) to define the subject
- crisp hard edges; no soft edge drift, no airbrush fade
- no depth cues or grounding of any kind

AUDIENCE & TONE (CRITICAL):
- These illustrations are for ADULT learners and adult users.
- The style must feel mature, neutral, and instructional — NOT playful or child-oriented.
- Do NOT use children’s illustration conventions (storybook look, toy-like shapes, cute exaggeration, playful faces).
- Avoid baby-like proportions, oversized heads, simplified “cute” eyes, or cartoon-for-kids aesthetics.

INVISIBLE GRID LAYOUT (DO NOT DRAW THE GRID):
- Grid is 5 columns × 4 rows.
- Each tile is exactly 256×256px.
- Horizontal gutter between tiles is exactly 24px, pure #FFFFFF.
- Vertical gutter between tiles is exactly 24px, pure #FFFFFF.
- Outer margin around the entire grid is exactly 24px on all 4 sides, pure #FFFFFF.
- Background everywhere (including gutters and margins) is flat pure white #FFFFFF.
- IMPORTANT: The grid is only for placement; do NOT draw borders, lines, boxes, frames, or separators.

EXTREME SPACING REQUIREMENT (THIS IS CRITICAL — DO NOT VIOLATE):
- The gutters (24px) MUST remain completely empty white space (#FFFFFF).
- NOTHING from a subject may enter the gutters: no outline, no shading, no anti-aliasing, no texture, no dots.
- Inside EACH tile there must be a DOUBLE SAFETY ZONE:
  1) SAFE PAD: Keep at least 56px of pure white padding INSIDE the tile on all 4 sides.
  2) GUTTER GUARD: Additionally keep a further 12px “no-ink” band INSIDE the tile edges.
- This means the entire subject must fit inside a centered 120×120px content box (47% of the tile).
- If uncertain, make subjects smaller. Whitespace is REQUIRED for correct slicing.

VERY IMPORTANT ANTI-OVERLAP RULE:
- The subject silhouette must not touch or approach the tile edge.
- Target subject size is only 55% of tile width/height (NOT 85%).
- Prefer smaller + well-centered over bigger.

GRID-LINE PREVENTION (READ CAREFULLY):
- Do NOT draw ANY grid lines, even faint.
- Do NOT draw a table, separators, dividers, guides, frames, borders, crop marks, bleed marks.
- Do NOT outline tiles.
- Do NOT add shading/noise/halftone dots in gutters or margins; they must be perfectly flat #FFFFFF.
- treat the entire canvas as a single white poster; tiles are implied only by spacing

FORBIDDEN (DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OF THESE):
- No table/grid lines, no tile borders, no separators
- No marks in gutters/margins (no outlines, no dots, no texture, no gradients)
- No outer border/frame around the whole sheet
- No text, no numbers, no labels, no watermark, no logo

ART STYLE (bold pop-art / comic-book ink + anime influence — high contrast, lots of linework, NO SHADOWS):
- TARGET AUDIENCE: ADULTS (young adults to adults), NOT children
- visual tone must feel mature, professional, and graphic — suitable for adult learning materials
- NO childish, cute, playful, toy-like, or storybook aesthetics
- NO kids-app, children’s book, sticker-for-kids, emoji, mascot, or nursery style
- modern stylized illustration with anime-inspired faces/proportions (NOT chibi, NOT kawaii)
- realistic adult proportions and facial structure (no oversized heads, no baby faces, no exaggerated cuteness)

- heavy graphic BLACK INK linework:
  - thick outer contour lines for silhouette clarity
  - medium interior contour lines for folds, hair strands, facial features, accessories
  - occasional spot blacks (solid black fill areas) for graphic contrast (hair, jackets, shadows INSIDE the subject only)
  - clean, confident strokes; no sketch pencil texture, no painterly brush edges

- pop-art / comic rendering:
  - flat color blocks + limited cel shading (2–4 tones)
  - optional halftone dots / Ben-Day dots / stipple texture ONLY inside the subject to imply tone
  - sharp, poster-like readability; bold graphic shapes

- color palette: saturated primary/secondary pop palette (yellow, red, cyan/teal, magenta accents) balanced with deep blacks
- crisp edges and print-like finish (screenprint/comic cover look), high resolution

LINEWORK REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
- outlines must be TRUE BLACK (#000000) or near-black
- edges must be hard and clean; NO soft airbrush feathering into white
- use lines to define form (do not rely on paint-edge silhouettes)
- At the subject boundary, there must be a single clean black outline adjacent to flat color—never a white fringe or gap.

CLOSED CONTOUR / NO OPEN BASE (CRITICAL — MUST OBEY):
- The outer contour MUST be a CLOSED LOOP around the entire silhouette (360°), including the BOTTOM edge.
- Do NOT leave the bottom un-outlined or “open” to the background.
- Do NOT let the silhouette be defined by a white fill that blends into the white background.
- If the subject has a flat cutoff at the bottom, it STILL needs a black contour line at that cutoff.

WHITE SUBJECTS / LIGHT FUR SPECIAL CASE (CRITICAL):
- If the subject contains white fur/feathers/skin (sheep, cow patches, duck body, panda, rabbit, etc.):
  - NEVER use pure white (#FFFFFF) for any area that touches the silhouette boundary.
  - Use off-white / slightly tinted light gray/cream instead for boundary-adjacent light areas.
  - The silhouette boundary must still be inked in black; white regions must be enclosed by black ink.

SILHOUETTE EDGE / OUTERMOST PIXEL RULE (CRITICAL — MUST OBEY):
- The OUTERMOST boundary pixels of the subject silhouette MUST be inked in TRUE BLACK (#000000) or near-black.
- Do NOT allow the silhouette to be defined by colored pixels without an outline.
- Do NOT allow semi-transparent edge pixels; no “soft” alpha edges.
- VISUAL TEST: If zoomed to 800%, the first non-white pixel when moving inward from the background must be black/near-black ink, not color and not light gray.
- EXTRA VISUAL TEST (BOTTOM EDGE): Along the lowest edge of the silhouette, the first boundary pixels must be black ink, never white fill.
- The black outline must be continuous around the entire silhouette (no breaks, no missing segments).

ABSOLUTE SHADOW / EFFECT BAN (MUST OBEY):
- NO drop shadow (below or around the subject)
- NO cast shadow, NO ground shadow, NO contact shadow, NO ambient shadow/occlusion
- NO vignette
- NO glow / halo / rim-light used as separation
- ALL shading must be inside the subject silhouette only

ABSOLUTE NO-SHADOW RULES (MOST IMPORTANT — DO NOT VIOLATE):
- absolutely NO drop shadow below or around the subject
- NO ground shadow, NO contact shadow, NO cast shadow, NO ambient shadow
- NO vignette, NO glow, NO halo
- background must stay perfectly flat #FFFFFF everywhere outside the subject
- if the model wants depth: use ONLY internal linework + flat/cel shading INSIDE the subject

HIGHLIGHT RULE:
- do NOT use pure white (#FFFFFF) inside the subject; use slightly tinted highlights instead.

NO WHITE / NEAR-WHITE EDGE OPENINGS (CRITICAL — FIXES “WHITE EDGES” FAILURES):
- Subjects must NOT have white or near-white “openings”, gaps, wedges, or cutouts along their outer edges.
- The silhouette must be CLOSED and SOLID: no background-white leaking into the subject at the boundary.
- Do NOT leave thin uncolored rims at the contour; do NOT create white inner borders.
- Avoid highlights that touch the outline if they could look like an opening; keep edge-adjacent highlights tinted and fully enclosed.
- At the subject boundary, there must be a single clean black outline adjacent to flat color—never a white fringe or gap.
- VISUAL TEST: If zoomed to 400%, there must be NO white/near-white pixels between the black outline and the subject fill anywhere along the boundary.
- EXTRA: This includes the BOTTOM of the subject — no white body area may “touch” the background without a black outline.

OUTERMOST EDGE INK ENFORCEMENT (CRITICAL — MUST OBEY):
- The outermost silhouette edge MUST be black/near-black ink, not colored pixels.
- There must be a continuous black contour around the silhouette (no missing outline segments), including the BOTTOM edge.
- VISUAL TEST: If you trace the silhouette border, every border pixel is black/near-black before any color fill appears.
- NO soft transparency/alpha at edges; edges must be crisp, poster-like, print-like.
- SPECIAL CASE (WHITE BODIES): Any light/white body area must be slightly tinted and fully enclosed by the black contour; never merge with the background.

COMPOSITION (strict, for EVERY tile):
- One main subject per tile.
- Subject must be centered horizontally AND vertically.
- Subject scale must be consistent across tiles.
- Subject MUST stay entirely inside the centered 120×120px content box.
- The tile edges must remain pure white with no marks, no outline, no shading.
- Keep silhouettes compact; avoid thin protrusions that might approach edges.
