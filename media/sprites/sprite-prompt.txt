Create EXACTLY ONE PNG sprite sheet image.

CANVAS SIZE (ABSOLUTE, MUST MATCH EXACTLY):
- The final PNG must be exactly 1704×1424 pixels.
- Do NOT add any extra padding, border, frame, shadow, or whitespace outside this canvas.
- Do NOT crop smaller than this size. Do NOT export larger than this size.

RENDERING OVERRIDES (CRITICAL):
- shadow-free sprites on pure white paper background
- use bold black ink linework (comic/pop linework) to define the subject
- crisp hard edges; no soft edge drift, no airbrush fade
- no depth cues or grounding of any kind

INVISIBLE GRID LAYOUT (DO NOT DRAW THE GRID):
- Grid is 6 columns × 5 rows.
- Each tile is exactly 256×256px.
- Horizontal gutter between tiles is exactly 24px, pure #FFFFFF.
- Vertical gutter between tiles is exactly 24px, pure #FFFFFF.
- Outer margin around the entire grid is exactly 24px on all 4 sides, pure #FFFFFF.
- Background everywhere (including gutters and margins) is flat pure white #FFFFFF.
- IMPORTANT: The grid is only for placement; do NOT draw borders, lines, boxes, frames, or separators.

EXTREME SPACING REQUIREMENT (THIS IS CRITICAL — DO NOT VIOLATE):
- The gutters (24px) MUST remain completely empty white space (#FFFFFF).
- NOTHING from a subject may enter the gutters: no outline, no shading, no anti-aliasing, no texture, no dots.
- Inside EACH tile there must be a DOUBLE SAFETY ZONE:
  1) SAFE PAD: Keep at least 56px of pure white padding INSIDE the tile on all 4 sides.
  2) GUTTER GUARD: Additionally keep a further 12px “no-ink” band INSIDE the tile edges.
- This means the entire subject must fit inside a centered 120×120px content box (47% of the tile).
- If uncertain, make subjects smaller. Whitespace is REQUIRED for correct slicing.

VERY IMPORTANT ANTI-OVERLAP RULE:
- The subject silhouette must not touch or approach the tile edge.
- Target subject size is only 55% of tile width/height (NOT 85%).
- Prefer smaller + well-centered over bigger.

GRID-LINE PREVENTION (READ CAREFULLY):
- Do NOT draw ANY grid lines, even faint.
- Do NOT draw a table, separators, dividers, guides, frames, borders, crop marks, bleed marks.
- Do NOT outline tiles.
- Do NOT add shading/noise/halftone dots in gutters or margins; they must be perfectly flat #FFFFFF.
- treat the entire canvas as a single white poster; tiles are implied only by spacing

FORBIDDEN (DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OF THESE):
- No table/grid lines, no tile borders, no separators
- No marks in gutters/margins (no outlines, no dots, no texture, no gradients)
- No outer border/frame around the whole sheet
- No text, no numbers, no labels, no watermark, no logo

ART STYLE (bold pop-art / comic-book ink + anime influence — high contrast, lots of linework, NO SHADOWS):
- modern stylized illustration with anime-inspired faces/proportions (NOT chibi, NOT kawaii)
- heavy graphic BLACK INK linework:
  - thick outer contour lines for silhouette clarity
  - medium interior contour lines for folds, hair strands, facial features, accessories
  - occasional spot blacks (solid black fill areas) for graphic contrast (hair, jackets, shadows INSIDE the subject only)
  - clean, confident strokes; no sketch pencil texture, no painterly brush edges
- pop-art / comic rendering:
  - flat color blocks + limited cel shading (2–4 tones)
  - optional halftone dots / Ben-Day dots / stipple texture ONLY inside the subject to imply tone
  - sharp, poster-like readability; bold graphic shapes
- color palette: saturated primary/secondary pop palette (yellow, red, cyan/teal, magenta accents) balanced with deep blacks
- crisp edges and print-like finish (screenprint/comic cover look), high resolution

LINEWORK REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
- outlines must be TRUE BLACK (#000000) or near-black
- edges must be hard and clean; NO soft airbrush feathering into white
- use lines to define form (do not rely on paint-edge silhouettes)

ABSOLUTE SHADOW / EFFECT BAN (MUST OBEY):
- NO drop shadow (below or around the subject)
- NO cast shadow, NO ground shadow, NO contact shadow, NO ambient shadow/occlusion
- NO vignette
- NO glow / halo / rim-light used as separation
- ALL shading must be inside the subject silhouette only

ABSOLUTE NO-SHADOW RULES (MOST IMPORTANT — DO NOT VIOLATE):
- absolutely NO drop shadow below or around the subject
- NO ground shadow, NO contact shadow, NO cast shadow, NO ambient shadow
- NO vignette, NO glow, NO halo
- background must stay perfectly flat #FFFFFF everywhere outside the subject
- if the model wants depth: use ONLY internal linework + flat/cel shading INSIDE the subject

HIGHLIGHT RULE:
- do NOT use pure white (#FFFFFF) inside the subject; use slightly tinted highlights instead.

COMPOSITION (strict, for EVERY tile):
- One main subject per tile.
- Subject must be centered horizontally AND vertically.
- Subject scale must be consistent across tiles.
- Subject MUST stay entirely inside the centered 120×120px content box.
- The tile edges must remain pure white with no marks, no outline, no shading.
- Keep silhouettes compact; avoid thin protrusions that might approach edges.

BATCH LABEL (for humans only, not drawn): batch
